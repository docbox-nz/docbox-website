# Building with cross

## Prerequisites

- Rust & Cargo (Install through rustup) https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started
- Docker https://www.docker.com/
- Cross https://github.com/cross-rs/cross

This is the quickest no-hassle method for building the server

### Install cross

You will need to install cross, you can do this using the following command:

```sh
cargo install cross --git https://github.com/cross-rs/cross
```

:::note
The command above will build and install cross from source. Cross also has other installation
methods such as pre-compiled binaries, see the [Github](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) for
more details
:::

## Building

You can now build the server with the following command:

```sh
cross build -p docbox --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --release
```

:::info
Docker must be running for this command to work. Cross will spin up a temporary
container to perform your build
